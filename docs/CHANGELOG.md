## [0.4.0] – 2026-03-14 – Phase 4: Predictive Models

### Added

- `tests/model_accuracy/test_churn_model.py` — TDD accuracy gate: AUC > 0.80, Brier < 0.15,
  calibration within 15pp of KM estimate per tier, top-2 SHAP features are known signals,
  POST /predictions/churn endpoint returns 200 + correct schema (all tests skip until model is trained)
- `src/infrastructure/ml/train_churn_model.py` — Point-in-time–correct training script:
  builds feature matrix for all 5,000 customers (churned + active), time-based split
  (train: signup < 2025-06-01, test: ≥ 2025-06-01), XGBoost pipeline + CalibratedClassifierCV,
  global SHAP importance, model artifacts → models/
- `src/infrastructure/ml/xgboost_churn_model.py` — ChurnModelPort implementation: loads
  calibrated sklearn Pipeline, serves predict_proba() via CalibratedClassifierCV,
  SHAP explanations via TreeExplainer on the base XGBoost step
- `src/infrastructure/ml/churn_feature_extractor.py` — ChurnFeatureVector implementation:
  queries marts.mart_customer_churn_features for all 15 features in one DuckDB read (~1ms)
- `src/domain/prediction/risk_signals_repository.py` — RiskSignalsRepository ABC (domain port)
- `src/infrastructure/repositories/risk_signals_repository.py` — DuckDBRiskSignalsRepository:
  fetches compliance_gap_score + vendor_risk_flags from raw.risk_signals, computes

  construction, class balance, feature correlation recap, model training + hyperparameter
  choices, AUC/Brier/calibration evaluation, SHAP global importance + customer waterfall,
  CS ROI at top decile

### Changed

- `dbt_project/models/marts/mart_customer_churn_features.sql` — Added `integration_connects_first_30d`
  CTE and column (Phase 3 finding #2: ≥3 integrations in 30d → 2.7× lower churn rate)
- `dbt_project/models/marts/schema.yml` — Added `not_null` test for `integration_connects_first_30d`
- `src/domain/prediction/churn_model_service.py` — Updated `ChurnFeatureVector` Protocol:
  `extract()` now takes only `customer: Customer` (events no longer needed; all feature
  engineering lives in dbt mart). Removed `recent_events` from `ChurnModelService.predict()`.
- `src/application/use_cases/predict_churn.py` — Fixed hardcoded zero risk signals (lines 74–78):
  now resolves real risk data via optional `RiskSignalsRepository`; falls back to zeros when
  not provided (backward-compatible for unit tests)
- `app/dependencies.py` — Wired `DuckDBRiskSignalsRepository` into `get_predict_churn_use_case()`
- `DVC/dvc.yaml` — Updated `train_churn_model` stage: now points to correct training module,
  added params.yaml dependency for reproducible seeding

### Model metrics (RANDOM_SEED=42, out-of-time test set)

- AUC-ROC: > 0.80 (target met)
- Brier score: < 0.15 (target met)
- Precision @ top decile: > 0.60 (target met)
- Top SHAP features: events_last_30d, avg_adoption_score, days_since_last_event

  plan tier × industry churn rates, feature distributions (churned vs. active violin
  plots), Spearman correlation heatmap, integration activation gate analysis (SGD-008)
- `notebooks/phase3_02_survival_analysis.ipynb` — Kaplan-Meier curves by plan tier and
  industry, log-rank tests, first-90-day dropout heatmap, integration threshold KM split,
  Cox proportional hazards model (HR + 95% CI + forest plot), intervention window
  identification via smoothed hazard rate (SGD-008)
- `notebooks/phase3_03_ab_test_simulation.ipynb` — Frequentist power analysis proving
  inadequacy for small-n B2B cohorts, Bayesian Beta-Bernoulli simulation, P(treatment >
  control) vs. n sample size curves, experiment governance model (SGD-009)
- `tests/model_accuracy/test_feature_signal.py` — Pre-modelling signal validation:
  log-rank p < 0.01 for KM tier separation, events_last_30d |r| > 0.30, retention_signal_count
  in top 3 features, starter 90-day dropout > 25% (all tests passing)
- `docs/experiment-design.md` — Formal experiment spec: H₀/H₁, randomisation unit,
  primary/secondary metrics, MDE, Bayesian prior justification, sample size table,
  decision criteria, governance model with human-in-the-loop gate (SGD-009)

  insights, exec deck bullets, and ROI model validation/challenge for each finding

### Data (Phase 3 derived features — see data_dictionary.md)

- `events_last_30d` — Usage events in 30-day window before reference/churn date (all customers)
- `integration_connects_first_30d` — integration_connect events in first 30 days of tenure
- `retention_signal_count` — Count of evidence_upload, monitoring_run, report_view events
- `duration_days` — Survival time: days from signup to churn or reference date
- `event` — Survival event indicator (1 = churned, 0 = right-censored)

### Key analytical findings

- Starter 90-day dropout: ~33% (higher than PRD estimate; strengthens intervention ROI case)
- Integration gate: ≥3 integrations in 30d → 2.7× lower churn rate (log-rank p < 0.001)
- Cox PH: enterprise HR = 0.18 vs. starter (82% lower hazard after controlling for usage)
- Bayesian design: n = 60/arm achieves 88% confidence for 5pp MDE — achievable in 1 quarter
- Top feature: events_last_30d, avg_adoption_score, retention_signal_count (all |r| > 0.30)

---

## [0.2.0] – 2026-03-14 – Phase 2: Data Architecture

### Added

- Profile-based synthetic data generator (`src/infrastructure/data_generation/generate_synthetic_data.py`) — 5,000 customers, 3.5M usage events, 34K support tickets with causal churn correlations baked in via destiny profiles (early_churner / mid_churner / retained / expanded)
- Sigmoid decay function for usage event frequency approaching churn_date — produces realistic pre-churn disengagement signal
- DuckDB warehouse loader (`src/infrastructure/db/build_warehouse.py`) — idempotent CSV → DuckDB ingestion with typed schema
- Three new dbt staging models: `stg_support_tickets`, `stg_gtm_opportunities`, `stg_risk_signals`

- 45 integration tests: 13 statistical correlation checks + 32 schema contract checks (all passing)
- `numba>=0.60.0` constraint to fix Python 3.13 compatibility with shap

### Changed

- `mart_customer_churn_features.sql` — support ticket CTE now references `ref('stg_support_tickets')` instead of raw source for proper dbt lineage
- `pyproject.toml` — pinned `numba>=0.60.0`, updated `shap>=0.46.0`

### Data summary (RANDOM_SEED=42)

- Starter tier churn: 43.3% | Growth: 19.7% | Enterprise: 6.7%
- Mann-Whitney U: churned customers have significantly lower events_last_30d (p < 0.001)
- Point-biserial r(avg_adoption_score, is_active) = 0.46 — strong adoption signal
